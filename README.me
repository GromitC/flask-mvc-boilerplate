This is a Flask MVC boilerplate that includes:

- Sentry logging with conditionals of live vs local 
- Login required decorator
- SQLAlchemy & MongoDB ready
- Models, Views, Controllers (Routes) structured via blueprints
- Route method (success vs error) handling
- Mailer class
- Configuration file

I welcome pull requests, as I'd help addressing the following enhancements:

- More context in Sentry logs
- MongoDB via ORM within env variables similar to SQLAlchemy
